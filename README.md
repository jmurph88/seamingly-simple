"# seamingly-simple" 

This is a website for a small sewing and quilting shop that my mom and I are the process of opening. We are still in the planning phase and additions will be made as the business plans are finalized and as the business progresses. 

It was created as my final project for Code Louisville's Front End Development Course. 

The project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
